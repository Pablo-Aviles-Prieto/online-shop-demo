  //////////////////////////////////////////////
  // line_items expects an array of objects defined such as the example commented.
  // Since we define price_data and create an obj on the fly that is filled with our products information.
  // Aswell for the key currency, we need to define since stripe's require to set this key in case we create a obj in the fly.
  // In product_data, name is a required field that we populate with info of our product/products.
  // And unit_amount_decimal we should use 'cents' instead of 'decimal', so we avoid problems with JS rounding numbers. Passing everything in cents, we can avoid that problem.
  // This obj (inside line_items) requires to set some key/values (others are optional). We can check in the stripe's page => https://stripe.com/docs/api/checkout/sessions/create#create_checkout_session-line_items-price_data
  // {
  //   price_data: {
  //     // We can chose price_data instead of price when we dont have the items/products that we wanna sell in the Stripes page, and only in our server/db.
  //     currency: 'usd',
  //     product_data: {
  //       name: 'Dummy',
  //     },
  //     unit_amount_decimal: 10.99,
  //   },
  //   quantity: 1,
  // },

  // Since we need to pass the products stored in the cart, we cant just pass the product obj as its saved in the DB, we need to redifine it (with help of .map(), since it return an array of items with the conditions we set) so it adjusts to the key properties that line_items objects needs. Also we need to map the array of items in the cart since the user can buy different products and not just one.
  // Here we get the cart from res.locals.cart (we can see the properties of the items stored in the cart, in the cart.model, in the function addItem, where it has a 'product' containing all the info of the product, 'quantity' to know how many same products is the user ordering and 'totalPrice' that is the total price of that exact item in case its selected more than 1 from the user to buy it).
  // Just to clarify we are using the item.product.price and not the item.totalPrice since Stripe's object wants to know the price of a single unit and the quantity to calculate it.

    line_items: cart.items.map((item) => {
      return {

          currency: 'usd',
          product_data: {
            name: item.product.title,
          },
          // We cant use the unit_amount_decimal since if we pass an amount of '99.99' Stripes translate it to '$0.9999' and with usd its not valid more  than 2 decimals (as it says in the error throwed by Stripes)
          // So in order to work, we just use unit_amount since it expects a value in cents (it doesnt expect a decimal number like _decimal, it expects an integer number).
          unit_amount: +item.product.price.toFixed(2) * 100, // Since Stripes is expecting a value in cents, we can change our value (that for example is $99.99) multiplying by 100 (so we get the value in cents) and then setting it fixed to 2 decimal numbers only.
